| [babel.config.js](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/babel.config.js)   | This code exports a configuration object that customizes Babel presets and plugins for Expo projects. It enables features like environment variables and provides additional functionality with the "react-native-dotenv" and "react-native-reanimated" plugins.‚Äã                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [firebase.ts](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/firebase.ts)           | The code initializes a Firebase app using the provided configuration. It also initializes authentication, Firestore, and storage services. The commented-out sections suggest additional features like messaging and local persistence. The initialized app, authentication, Firestore, and storage instances are exported for use in other modules.                                                                                                               |
| [Styles.config.ts](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/Styles.config.ts) | In this code snippet, we are using React Native's StyleSheet module to create styling rules. It includes styles for icons, buttons, text, heading containers, and header text. The styles are defined using properties like width, height, borderRadius, backgroundColor, padding, justifyContent, alignItems, and position. The theme is imported from a separate configuration file. This code helps maintain consistency in styling throughout the application. |
| [Images.config.ts](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/Images.config.ts) | The code defines a configuration object that contains various image assets. These assets are imported and assigned as values to specific keys. The exported object can be used to access the image assets throughout the codebase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [env.d.ts](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/env.d.ts)                 | The code is declaring a module that exports a constant variable REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL of type string, allowing access to the backend URL through this module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [App.tsx](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/App.tsx)                   | This code sets up the Redux store and provides it to the app components using the Provider component from react-redux. It renders the VoiceHub component, which serves as the entry point for the app's functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [Friends.tsx](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/src/tabs/main/Friends/Friends.tsx) | This code represents a React Native component that manages the navigation between two screens. It sets up a navigation stack using the `createStackNavigator` function and defines two screens: "Default" and "AddFriend". The component receives `route` and `navigation` as props and uses them to determine the initial route and navigate between the screens. |
| [Default.tsx](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/src/tabs/main/Friends/Default.tsx) | This code implements a screen for displaying friends, friend requests, and pending friend requests. It utilizes React Native components and navigation to achieve the desired functionality. Users can add friends, view their friends list, and handle friend requests through this screen.                                                                       |
