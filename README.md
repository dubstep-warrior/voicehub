## 📍 Overview

VoiceHub is a React Native app that aims to provide a comprehensive chat experience. It incorporates key features such as user authentication, real-time messaging, profile management, and friend connections. The project utilizes Firebase for its backend services, ensuring secure and reliable messaging. VoiceHub offers a customizable and user-friendly interface, supporting seamless communication and collaboration for individuals and groups.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Firebase Initialization: 
    - The firebase.ts file initializes a Firebase app using the provided configuration, including authentication, Firestore, and storage services. 
    - Exported instances of Firebase services are made available for use in other modules.
- Redux Store Setup: 
    - In App.tsx, the Redux store is set up and provided to app components using the Provider component from react-redux.
    - It renders the VoiceHub component, serving as the app's entry point for functionality.
- Authentication: 
    - In VoiceHub.tsx, Firebase and React Navigation are used for authentication. 
    - Users can log in or register, and the app redirects them accordingly.  
- Tabbed Pages Template: 
    - StandardTabPage.tsx defines a template for creating tabbed pages in a React Native app.
    - It provides a safe area for content, customizable heading sections, and child component management.
- User Profile Management: 
    - Profile.tsx and Default.tsx components in the Profile section allow users to view and update their profile information. 
    - Features include updating name and email, logging out, and managing profile images.
- Friends Management: 
    - Friends.tsx and Default.tsx components in the Friends section manage navigation between screens for viewing friends, friend requests, and adding friends.
- User Chat and Messaging: 
    - In the Home section, Chat.tsx, Default.tsx, and Home.tsx components implement chat features. Users can send messages, view chat lists, and select chats.
- Tab Configuration: 
    - In the Config section, Main.config.ts defines main tabs for the mobile application. Tabs include Home, Friends, and Profile.
- Redux Hooks: hooks.ts provides custom hooks, useAppDispatch and useAppSelector, for using Redux's dispatch and selector functions in a React app. They have typings for AppDispatch and RootState.
- State Management:
    - State management in this app revolves around Redux slices, hooks for easy access, and Firebase for real-time data synchronization and authentication. These components work together to ensure a consistent and responsive user experience.
    - Asynchronous calls to firebase to resolve feature functionality is implemented in Redux thunks.
- Utility Functions: 
    - Subscribers.ts retrieves chat data and updates the app state with messages and notifications from the Firestore database.
    - FileUploader.ts allows users to upload images to Firebase storage and retrieve download URLs. 
    - StartChat.ts starts chats with selected users, updating Redux state and navigating to the Chat screen.
