## 📍 Overview

VoiceHub is a React Native app that aims to provide a comprehensive chat experience. It incorporates key features such as user authentication, real-time messaging, profile management, and friend connections. The project utilizes Firebase for its backend services, ensuring secure and reliable messaging. VoiceHub offers a customizable and user-friendly interface, supporting seamless communication and collaboration for individuals and groups.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Firebase Initialization: 
    - The firebase.ts file initializes a Firebase app using the provided configuration, including authentication, Firestore, and storage services. 
    - Exported instances of Firebase services are made available for use in other modules.
- Redux Store Setup: 
    - In App.tsx, the Redux store is set up and provided to app components using the Provider component from react-redux.
    - It renders the VoiceHub component, serving as the app's entry point for functionality.
- Authentication: 
    - In VoiceHub.tsx, Firebase and React Navigation are used for authentication. 
    - Users can log in or register, and the app redirects them accordingly.  
- Tabbed Pages Template: 
    - StandardTabPage.tsx defines a template for creating tabbed pages in a React Native app.
    - It provides a safe area for content, customizable heading sections, and child component management.
- User Profile Management: 
    - Profile.tsx and Default.tsx components in the Profile section allow users to view and update their profile information. 
    - Features include updating name and email, logging out, and managing profile images.
- Friends Management: 
    - Friends.tsx and Default.tsx components in the Friends section manage navigation between screens for viewing friends, friend requests, and adding friends.
- User Chat and Messaging: 
    - In the Home section, Chat.tsx, Default.tsx, and Home.tsx components implement chat features. Users can send messages, view chat lists, and select chats.
- Tab Configuration: 
    - In the Config section, Main.config.ts defines main tabs for the mobile application. Tabs include Home, Friends, and Profile.
- Redux Hooks: hooks.ts provides custom hooks, useAppDispatch and useAppSelector, for using Redux's dispatch and selector functions in a React app. They have typings for AppDispatch and RootState.
- State Management:
    - State management in this app revolves around Redux slices, hooks for easy access, and Firebase for real-time data synchronization and authentication. These components work together to ensure a consistent and responsive user experience.
    - Asynchronous calls to firebase to resolve feature functionality is implemented in Redux thunks.
- Utility Functions: 
    - Subscribers.ts retrieves chat data and updates the app state with messages and notifications from the Firestore database.
    - FileUploader.ts allows users to upload images to Firebase storage and retrieve download URLs. 
    - StartChat.ts starts chats with selected users, updating Redux state and navigating to the Chat screen.

| [Profile.tsx](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/src/tabs/main/Profile/Profile.tsx) | This code is a component called Profile that uses React Navigation to create a Stack Navigator with two screens: Default and UpdateField. It retrieves the user state from the Redux store and conditionally renders the navigator if the user state exists. The navigator is provided with initial params for each screen to set the current route. The header is hidden for all screens.                                                                       |
| [Default.tsx](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/voicehub/blob/main/src/tabs/main/Profile/Default.tsx) | This code is a React Native component that displays a user's profile information and allows them to update specific fields. It retrieves user data from the state, displays the profile overview, and renders sections with options for field updates. When an option is selected, it navigates to the "UpdateField" screen with the selected field data. The component also includes a logout button and uses various styles to layout and format the elements. |
